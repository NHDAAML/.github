# North Houston Data Analytics and Machine Learning
## Welcome
We are a community of data practitioners mostly located north of Houston, TX proper. This GitHub organization contains a record of code and materials presented at our regular meetings, and used for ongoing collaboration.
## Goals
- Create a regular venue for all-levels-accessible discussion of and learning about modern topics in data analytics and machine learning
- Contribute back to the larger community by collectively preparing for conferences and contributing to open source projects
## Meet us
[Find us on Meetup!](https://www.meetup.com/north-houston-data-analytics-and-machine-learning/) We aim for monthly in-person meetings, held at the Montgomery County South Regional Library in The Woodlands, TX.
